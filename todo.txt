- Loading r_0 must be reviewed (causing problems with loading W).
- Runs slowly in general. Use broadcasting for arrays in dfs.d_theta_d_t. Also simplify periodic boundary condition distance calculations.

- Spirals not yet achievable, but something like a traveling roll is.
- Change num_video_loops to 100 (or use while loop) and interpolation to 'bicubic' for cooler visuals.
